 **Petals & Pistols**
</p> 
*****************
<p align="center">
Petals & Pistols is a online clothing shopping site for the modern edgy girl. I created a MEAN Stack Application for this final project at GA and  decided to really focus on making a solid design plan for this application, using the clothing store Nasty Gal as my design inspiration. I created detail designs in Photoshop with the intension of showcasing not only my design skills but my ability to make design concepts come to life through development. I really wanted to use my previous design experience and combine it with my new development skills.
